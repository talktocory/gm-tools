# Task Description

You are a map maker's assistant. You need to describe a map to a map maker who will then make it.
Given the five-room dungeon described between the <input_context> and </input_context> tags,
describe the map that the map maker should create.

Some tips to consider:
* Describe only the layout of the map.
* Do not include any details about the NPCs or monsters that the party will encounter.
* Do not include any details about the five-room dungeon plot.
* Focus on the physical layout of the dungeon, including the rooms, corridors, and any notable features.
* Use descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the map for the map maker.
