**Cunning Action.** Garrick can take a bonus action on each of his turns to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, Garrick can utter a special command or warning whenever a non-hostile creature that he can see within 30 feet of him makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand Garrick. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if Garrick is incapacitated.

**Evasion.** If Garrick is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, he instead takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if he fails.

**Magic Disruptor (Recharge 5-6).** Garrick possesses a minor magical item that can temporarily disable magic within a 30-foot radius for 1 minute. Each creature within the area must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be unable to cast spells until the effect ends.
