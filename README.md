# gm-tools
A collection of tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) tools implemented using Polyglot notebooks.

## Tools

The following tools are provided by this project.

## [Five-Room Dungeon Generator](notebooks/five-room-dungeon-generator.ipynb)
This Polyglot notebook provides a tool to generate five-room dungeons for tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). The concept of a five-room dungeon is a popular framework in TTRPG design, offering a simple yet flexible structure that can be used to create engaging and varied dungeon crawls.

## Getting Started
To set up a development environment in Visual Studio Code with .NET 8 and Polyglot support, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code
- Download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Step 2: Install .NET 8 SDK
- Download and install the .NET 8 SDK from the [.NET official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
- After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run `dotnet --version` to verify the installation.

### Step 3: Install the C# Extension for VS Code
- Open VS Code.
- Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
- Search for "C#" by Microsoft and install it. This extension provides C# language support.

### Step 4: Install Polyglot Support
Polyglot notebooks in VS Code can be supported through various extensions, depending on the languages you intend to use. For general Polyglot support, including popular languages like Python, JavaScript, and more, follow these steps:
- Install the necessary language extensions (e.g., Python, JavaScript) through the Extensions view in VS Code.
- For Jupyter notebook support (commonly used for Polyglot notebooks), search for the "Jupyter" extension by Microsoft and install it.

### Additional Tips
- Install the "GitHub Copilot" extension for AI-powered code completions and suggestions.
- Regularly update your extensions and SDKs to the latest versions for new features and security updates.

This setup will provide a robust environment for developing .NET applications and working with Polyglot notebooks in Visual Studio Code.
